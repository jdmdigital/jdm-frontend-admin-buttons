JDM Frontend Admin Buttons is a lightweight WordPress plugin that hides the default Admin Bar and replaces it with out of the way, contextually-aware, floating buttons for basic admin tasks.

== Description ==
The WordPress admin bar gets in the way of basic frontend management of your WordPress site&mdash;esspecially if you have a fixed main navigation.  This simple and VERY light-weight plugin offers floating buttons that are contextually-aware and fixed to one side so they're out of the way.

= Vision = 
A few goals we had in making this plugin:

*	Keep it free and feature-rich
*	Keep it simple (stupid)
*	Must be SUPER lightweight (we hate plugin bloat)
*	Build for developers and noobs alike


== Installation ==
This plugin is not, yet, avaliable on the WordPress repo.  To install it, you'll need to use the [GitHub Updater](https://github.com/afragen/github-updater) plugin for automatic updates.  Of course, you could just install/upgrade it manually using FTP, but that's boring.

1. Install the plugin, and the updater - [tutorial here for using GitHub Updater](https://jdmdigital.co/labs/demo/github-updates/)
1. Activate the plugin
1. That's it!  Seriously. 

There's no settings page.  It does all the feature and role detection work for you.
